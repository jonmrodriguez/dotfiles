# have tcsh just immediately switch to bash

# if I were really cool I would exec bash using this process number
# so that the SHLVL doesn't increase (from 1 to 2 I believe)

bash

# ok, I tried doing exec bash, but for some reason SHLVL still increases. a tcsh bug?

# TODO why isn't exit working?
# exit
exec true # same effect as exit, but more devious. BWAHAHA
